# Computational_Biology_UPM

Hi Everyone,

My name is Adrián Barreno Sánchez, I got my BSc in Helth Biology by the University of Alcala (UAH) in the year 2021, and I am currently enrolled in the MSc Programme in Computational Biology by the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), during the academic year 2022-2023.

In this repository, I will upload my scripts for the lessons, projects and assigments of the different courses in in which I am enrolled. I hope that this content will serve as an inspiration and help future students and apprentices in the exciting field of bioinformatics. Please, feel free to contact me if you have any doubt, consideration or advice regarding the content of this repository.

Have a nice day!

Adrián
